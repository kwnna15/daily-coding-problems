# 283. Move Zeroes

## Description
See https://leetcode.com/problems/move-zeroes/description/

## Problem
Given an integer array `nums`, move all `0`'s to the end of     it while maintaining the relative order of the non-zero elements.

Note that you must do this in-place without making a copy of the array.

## Example 1

```
Input: nums = [0,1,0,3,12]
Output: [1,3,12,0,0]
```

## Example 2

```
Input: nums = [0]
Output: [0]
```

## Example 3

```
Input: str1 = "LEET", str2 = "CODE"
Output: ""
```

## Constraints

```
1 <= nums.length <= 104
-231 <= nums[i] <= 231 - 1
```
